Where do misconceptions live? Are they tied to learning objectives - or assessment questions?
    Tied tightly assessment question -> loosely to learning objectives
    Multiple misconceptions can be reused across assessment questions
    So they are top-level elements, with an independent existence (but obviously can be referenced)
Where does evaluation live?
    Are they alongside the resources in the repository?
        What happens when I modify/delete a resource?
    Do they live seperate?
