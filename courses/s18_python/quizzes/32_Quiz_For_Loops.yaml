    Trace the values of this code. If a variable is not yet defined, put an "X"
    (without quotes).

    ```python
    grades = [10, 20]
    total = 0
    for grade in grades:
        adjusted = grade + 10
        total = total + adjusted

    ```

    step | line | grades | grade | adjusted | total  
    ---|---|---|---|---|---  
    1 | 1 | [10,20] | X | X | X  
    2 | 2 | [10,20] | [grade2] | X | [total2]  
    3 | 3 | [10,20] | [grade3] | X | [total3]  
    4 | 4 | [10,20] | [grade4] | 20 | [total4]

  incorrect_comments: "This one is long and tricky! Here are some recommendations:\
    \  Do the calculations on paper or double check each step in IPython or BlockPy.\
    \ Know what value grade should take on with respect to grades. Which line changes\
    \ its value? If you don't seem to be making progress, don't be afraid to get help!"
