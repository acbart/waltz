  answers:
  - text: List
    comments: This is the type of the List Variable, but not the type of the Iteration
      Variable. Remember, the Iteration Variable will have the subtype of the List
      Variable, not its type.

  - text: String
    weight: 100
  - text: Integer
    comments: No, this is not the type of the Iteration Variable. The Iteration Variable's
      type is the subtype of the List Variable.
    weight: 0
  - text: None
    comments: No, the Iteration Variable definitely has a type.

  answers:
  - text: The body of a for loop will have one statement for each element of the iteration
      list.
    comments: A for loop can have any number of statements, and any number of items
      in the Iteration List. It is possible these two numbers will be the same, but
      it's not required.
    comments_html: A <code>for</code> loop can have any number of statements, and
      any number of items in the Iteration List. It is possible these two numbers
      will be the same, but it's not required.

  - text: for Loops and Functions are basically the same thing
    comments: Although they have similarities (e.g,. the colon, the fact that they
      both affect control flow), there are many differences between loops and functions.
      Primarily, Functions are a way to change some inputs into some outputs; Loops
      are a way to repeatedly perform some actions for each element of a list.

  - text: The Iteration Variable will take on each value of the List Variable, one
      at a time.
    weight: 100
  - text: for Loops always execute the body four times, which is where they get their
      name.
    comments: This statement is not true. The word "for" in the name of for loops
      gets its name from the preposition "for", not the number "four". When read aloud,
      the idea is something like, "For each element of the list...".

  - text: Like an if statement and a Function Call, the for Loop might cause the execution
      to not follow the order of lines.

- question_name: Loop Tracing
  question_type: fill_in_multiple_blanks_question
  question_text: |
    Trace the values of this code. If a variable is not yet defined, put an "X"
    (without quotes).

    ```python
    grades = [10, 20]
    total = 0
    for grade in grades:
        adjusted = grade + 10
        total = total + adjusted

    ```

    step | line | grades | grade | adjusted | total  
    ---|---|---|---|---|---  
    1 | 1 | [10,20] | X | X | X  
    2 | 2 | [10,20] | [grade2] | X | [total2]  
    3 | 3 | [10,20] | [grade3] | X | [total3]  
    4 | 4 | [10,20] | [grade4] | 20 | [total4]  
    5 | [line5] | [10,20] | [grade5] | [adjusted5] | [total5]  
    6 | [line6] | [grades6] | [grade6] | [adjusted6] | [total6]  
    7 | [line7] | [10,20] | [grade7] | [adjusted7] | [total7]  
    8 | [line8] | [10,20] | [grade8] | [adjusted8] | 50

    This one is long and tricky! Here are some recommendations:
    
      1. Do the calculations on paper or double check each step in IPython or BlockPy.
      2. Know what value `grade` should take on with respect to `grades`. Which line changes its value?
      3. If you don't seem to be making progress, don't be afraid to get help!
