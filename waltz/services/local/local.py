    The local filesystem which can hold the Markdown version of files.

    The filesystem layout shall not be strict. Instructors are free to organize however
    they see fit, and the system has to deal with it. If the instructors choose to buy
    in, then they get the added advantage of being able to relayout their directory
    automatically. Reorganize function - can regroup resources by category or by time.

    Index Database - a sqlite database that is used to hold temporary versions of files.
    This should not be committed to your database. Or maybe this should be compressed files
    on the hard drive so that they can be committed? No, because that makes merges from separate
    branches too intractable. If you want version control of a file, then its up to you to talk
    to your VCS about it - we are not responsible for version controlling your file. This is just
    a mechanism for helping us manage data.

    To be "Waltz-Aware", a Resource file needs to be markdown (required?) that has front-matter with
    the key "waltz". Or something? We should figure this out. That's just the ones that can be
    conveniently detected. The Local service can notice all Markdown files and manipulate them.

    Fundamentally, what is a Resource to the Local Service? Let's take a bunch of examples and styles.

        You can have a stand-alone file that you push/pull by filename
        You can have a special file that sits next to the file and acts as info, has to travel with it
        You can have a folder with a special index file that lets you sync a directory

    Let's talk about how people want to identify resources.
        Filename, full path to file
        Title of resource
        Partial title of resource
        Unique ID + category

    Let's explore some scenarios:
        Programming problem sets:
            I download "Programming 25) Unit Tests", a Canvas Assignment
            I also grab "Programming 25) Unit Tests", a BlockPy Group

        Final Project:
            I download "Final Project" a Canvas Assignment
                Final Project.md
            I download "Final Project" a BlockPy Assignment
                Final Project.md
            I download "Final Project" a Canvas Page
                Final Project.md

        In theory, Canvas is perfectly happy to have 10 assignments all named "Banana"
            I suppose we need a fully qualified name to resolve ambiguities
            Title_Service_Category_Id.md
            It'll try to pick the shortest possible name that is unambigious, preferring
            these components: Title, Category, Service, Id
