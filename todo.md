If you run waltz without arguments, gives an error.

Test with bad URL, see the confsued error message; capture the error and
give a better error mesage "Check your network connection or connection
URL".

If you have a misconfigured course ID, it's pretty unfriendly.

Trailing slash on URL should not be required to type. Add it
automatically.

Ugly error messages:
    waltz pull canvas page

Autocomplete for resources

Use partial names

Allow periods in Title of Pages

Allow .md (filename) as title

Document very clearly that Canvas is HTML, but Waltz is building
Markdown. And clearly document what flavor of Markdown we're using.
